/** A pari-mutuel market on which miner takes the next Zcash block.
 *
 * Everyone who backed the winner splits the rest of the pool in proportion to
 * what they put in, less the house's cut. Nobody trades against the house,
 * so the house cannot want an outcome — and could not reach it if it did,
 * because reaching it means buying hashrate.
 *
 * Stakes ride in shielded memos, so until a block lands nobody can see how
 * the pool leans. That matters here in a way it would not on a coin flip:
 * published pool shares are computed over 24-hour windows, so a miner moving
 * between pools is visible in the block stream hours before any dashboard
 * catches up. Somebody watching the chain knows something. Sealing the book
 * is what lets them act on it without giving it away. */
